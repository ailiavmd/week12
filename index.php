        <p>
            Recently graduated from Vanarts, Vancouver Institute of Media Arts in Game Art & Design, 
            I am a Junior Character Artist looking for new experiences to tap into my talent in the 
            3D industry. I discovered Photoshop during a linguistic exchange program in U.S. and I 
            have been immediately fascinated by this software. Upon my return from this trip, I chose 
            to orient myself towards computer graphics for my post-secondary education. I started 
            my Bachelor's degree in Computer Graphics at ESIAJ, Belgium and that's where it all started ...
        </p>
        <p>
            Learning 3D was a revelation to me! I had not just only discovered more powerful softwares 
            that give an infinite possibility of creativity but I had also found my passion! I had 
            finally the chance to mix my artistic sensibility that I had so much trouble to exploit since 
            my childhood with the technology of computers. It was the perfect balance! Since then, I 
            have been eager to learn and to perfect myself to carry out projects combining an artistic and technical side.
